## Overview

This project aims to build a smart automatic door system capable of recognizing license plates using **ESP32-CAM** and **OpenCV**. The system sends relevant data to a **NestJS**-powered web server, which processes the information and manages door control actions.

This README is a work in progress, and the project is still under active development. Stay tuned for updates!

## Features

- **License Plate Recognition**: Automatically detects and identifies vehicle license plates using the ESP32-CAM and OpenCV.
- **Remote Control**: Control the door remotely through a web server powered by NestJS.
- **Secure Access**: The door only opens for recognized license plates, providing secure access.
- **Customizable Actions**: Configurable actions such as door open/close timings and security features.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor access logs in real-time via the web interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Python** (for OpenCV integration)
- **ESP32-CAM module**
- **RFID module** (optional, for RFID-based access)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    For the web server:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    For the OpenCV setup:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Setup ESP32-CAM**:
    Flash the appropriate firmware on the ESP32-CAM following [this guide](link-to-guide).

5. **Start the web server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the web server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Connect the ESP32-CAM to the system and ensure it's broadcasting video and capturing images for license plate recognition.

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` to monitor and control the door.

### Example Commands

- **To recognize a license plate**:
    ```bash
    python recognize_plate.py --image path/to/image
    ```
